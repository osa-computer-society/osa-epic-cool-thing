# OSA Epic Cool Thing

Embark on a new and reimagined high school journey in this epic 2D RPG!

## Getting Started

You'll need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) installed. You'll also need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

- If you are new to Git, we strongly recommend going through the `Beginner`, `Getting Started`, and `Collaborating` sections of the phenomenal [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control). Note that we will be using GitHub instead of Bitbucket. We will be using the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) in this project to manage branches and releases.

- On a Mac, to open Godot, you may need to go to the `Applications` folder, right click `Godot`, and then click `Open`.

Join the @osa-computer-society/osa-epic-cool-thing team to get access to this repository. Clone this repository.

Open Godot to the main Project Manager. Click `Import` in the right sidebar. In the file explorer, navigate to this project and select the `project.godot` file inside. This should open the main Godot game editor view. Now, you can begin implementing whatever features you want.

Please follow the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) when creating branches and pull requests.

To suggest a new feature, go to the [`Issues` tab](https://github.com/osa-computer-society/osa-epic-cool-thing/issues) and open a new issue.
